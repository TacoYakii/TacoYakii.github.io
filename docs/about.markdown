This blog is intended to record my personal study experiences. I plan to introduce interesting techniques and theories that I found noteworthy while attending graduate school. I will primariily focus on theories related to time series analysis and content from industrial engineering. I hope that reading my posts will be somewhat helful for your studies. <br><br>
